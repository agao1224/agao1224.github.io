cuetips is my Electrical & Computer Engineering capstone project. The idea is real-life Gamepigeon 8-ball pool. When a user picks up their cue stick and aims at various cue balls, there will be a projector shining down instantaneous trajectory predictions.

We're currently in week 8/14 of our capstone project, and things are coming together. We recently submitted a [design review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZKvjEFzM0V9P12CyuFw8NCZ0gdvfrAfQ/view?usp=sharing) that more-or-less summarizes our current progress and what we have left to accomplish. Currently, the hardest part about this project is by far processing each frame end-to-end in 100ms. This was a challenging technical feat we wanted to take on, though it's proving to be pretty difficult. Doing object detection with zero machine learning is hard, on top of optimizing every line of code to run as fast and efficient as possible.

Will update this page at the end of the semester when we finish the capstone project.
