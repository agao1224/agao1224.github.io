I lead a bible study group at my local church and wanted a tool for annotating the Bible on my Mac. I managed to hack together a Desktop app for my Macbook, though it's still a work in progress. It's called [solomon](https://github.com/agao1224/solomon), written with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/), [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/), and vanilla HTML + Javascript.
